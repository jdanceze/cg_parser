Across repeated edges (same src,dest but different offset), 
everything except fanout remains the same. Hence once we handle fanout,
we can simply throw out the repeated edges.
For fanout in this case now gets replaced by 'average_fanout' and 'min_fanout'

    Algorithm 1 of "Estimating the Number of s-t Paths in a Graph"
    by Ben Roberts and Dirk P. Kroese.
    Algorithm 1 is chosen instead of Algorithm 2 since it is 
    biased towards shorter paths, which is what we want.
    (Algorithm Assumption - main must be an orphan node.)

    Note: The original algorithm is for the number of s-t path
    If we enumerate over all nodes 't' and compute the number
    of paths from main, the complexity for each graph is
    = #nodes * lengthOfRandomWalk * #simulationIterations
    = O(n) * O(n) * 10k
    = 10^12 (if n=10^4)
    (* #programs * #analyses for a total count)

    Hence we implement an approximation of this algorithm
    wherein we calculate liklihoods of all nodes along the
    random walk instead of just 1 source node.
    1. Do a random walk without repeating nodes
    2. At each step likelihood = likelihood/node_degree
